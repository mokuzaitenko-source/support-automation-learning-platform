Interactive Flask app for learning Python with lesson paths, code execution, and progress tracking.

## What I Built

- Structured lesson and learning-path experience
- Browser-based Python execution with output/error handling
- Progress tracking across lessons
- Route-level app checks with Flask test client

## Run Locally

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000`.

## Test

```powershell
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'
python test_all_features.py
```

## Results

- All core route and execution checks pass
- Portfolio-ready codebase with clear structure and docs
